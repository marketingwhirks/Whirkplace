Perfect — thanks, that’s gold. Now I know: Whirkplace = culture, communication, and team improvement app (like 15Five, but presumably leaner/fresher). That puts you squarely in the HR / performance / employee engagement SaaS category — which is notorious for fluffy promises, buzzwords, and hiding churn or adoption struggles.

That’s your opening. Instead of “rah-rah” culture-speak, we go full radical transparency: what it really costs, when it fails, what clients complain about, what you’d never see on a competitor’s landing page.

Here are 15 taboo-smashing video ideas tailored to Whirkplace:

🔥 Notice the angle: this isn’t “rah rah culture makes profits.” It’s showing where culture software fails, how adoption craters, and the mistakes execs make. Competitors avoid this because it feels negative. But your audience (leaders who’ve already been burned) will instantly trust you for exposing it.

Do you want me to take this one step further and map these 15 ideas into actual YouTube/TikTok series formats (e.g., “Culture Myths Monday,” “Live Feedback Fridays”)? That way, you’ll have not just ideas but a repeatable content engine.
